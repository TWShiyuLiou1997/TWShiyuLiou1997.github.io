[Firmware Release] [Padavan + CAKE Port] TP-Link Archer C2 V1 (with 3.4.113 Linux Kernel) & Phicomm K2P A1/A2 (with 4.4.198 Linux Kernel)

[https://www.mobile01.com/topicdetail.php?f=110&t=7220226](https://www.mobile01.com/topicdetail.php?f=110&t=7220226)

This is my independent project and the world's first successful port of the **CAKE traffic control algorithm** to Padavan (including both Linux Kernel 3.4.113 and Linux Kernel 4.4.198)!
 
Not only have I resurrected the classic TP-Link Archer C2 and Phicomm K2P, but I have also significantly expanded the supported device list. This project **accurately supports 142 router models at once**, with up to **14 multi-language packs available**!
 
## 📌 Firmware Features Overview
 
* **Kernel Breakthrough:** Provides dual versions of Linux Kernel 3.4.113 and 4.4.198, significantly ahead of the original old kernels.
* **Performance Unleashed:** Fully integrated CAKE traffic scheduling, HWNAT (Hardware Acceleration) + SFE (Software Acceleration).
* **UI Optimization:** Built-in multi-language support, with layout optimized for 1080P widescreen.
* **Stability Boost:** Fixed MT7610E wireless disconnect issues, enabled fast reconnection; the 4.4 version uses the most stable Iptables 1.8.7 and libmnl 1.0.5 combo.
* **Security Enhancements:** Fully upgraded Busybox to 1.37.0, fixing multiple high-risk CVE vulnerabilities.

*(Note: My previous older projects were hosted under my old account TWShiyuLiou1997. Now, all successful builds are centralized in the new **TW641** account.

## 🕊️ In Loving Memory of Dave Täht (The Soul of Bufferbloat Mitigation)
<a href="images/davetaht.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;" src="images/davetaht.jpg" width="3024" height="4032" alt="Dave Täht Tribute"></a>

> **"When you miss Dave, modprobe sch_cake!"**
>
> — *A tribute to the soul of bufferbloat mitigation.*

### **🇹🇼: 他的心願，我來實現 (Tā de xīn yuàn, wǒ lái shí xiàn)** 
### **🇺🇸: His wish, I finished.** Dave Täht (1965–2025) was a great open-source contributor in network technology. He turned down countless high-paying contracts just to keep his code free and open-source. Because of his research in the Bufferbloat field, countless devices today enjoy smooth networking.

**🏹 A Coincidence Across Time: Archer and Arrow**

There is a Chinese idiom: **"A single arrow pierces the clouds, and thousands of troops come to meet."**
 
Dave is like that cloud-piercing arrow tearing through the dark night of network congestion. Coincidentally, when he demonstrated the CAKE algorithm in 2015, the test device he used was the **TP-Link Archer C7**; in 2016, he used an **odroid C2** to test the driver.
 
Today, I successfully ported his **final legacy** to the **TP-Link Archer C2**. Dave is the Archer, this code is the Arrow, and I successfully hit the target: a beautiful world without Bufferbloat.

**🧩 A Belated Promise: The MT76 Prophecy**

In 2016, Dave wrote on his **blog** that he struggled to find a MediaTek (MT76) based router, predicting it would be the rising star of open-source networking.
 
Years later, through **this project**, I've enabled thousands of MT76 devices to smoothly run the CAKE algorithm he wrote.
 
**"Dave, I finally got this MT76 running for you!"**

**🌟 Light a Star, Let the Love Continue**
 
Dave's surname **"Täht"** means **"Star"** in Estonian. If you use my firmware, please go to the GitHub open-source memorial repository and light up that "Star" for me to continue Dave Täht's spirit!

## 🔧 Tech 101 | Why Does Your Network Need CAKE? 
Built on the mature foundation of fq_codel, CAKE is a state-of-the-art Active Queue Management (AQM) technology. With CAKE, heavy bulk transfers no longer interrupt real-time applications. Even if your family is downloading large files, your online games will still maintain a low Ping✅.

### 🍰 Why is it called "CAKE"? 
The name originates from the movie "2010" and the game "Portal", representing the beautiful vision that everyone gets a piece of the cake. It actually stands for Common Applications Kept Enhanced. Simply put, it ensures that when multiple people use the network, everyone still gets bandwidth, keeping things smooth and stutter-free.

### ⚙️ Quick Guide to How It Works
<a href="images/CAKE.png" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;" src="images/CAKE.png" width="1779" height="1155"></a>
CAKE's primary goal is to eliminate Bufferbloat.

**Its Core Features:**
* **Traffic Shaping:** Limits ingress and egress bandwidth to ensure **network packets** don't pile up in nodes like modems.
* **Fair Queuing:** Ensures every device gets a fair share of bandwidth, preventing a single application from hogging the network.
* **Automated Management:** Compared to older QoS, CAKE usually only requires setting the download and upload bandwidth limits to achieve excellent results.

⚠️ **Note:** CAKE is relatively CPU-intensive. It may become a performance bottleneck on weaker routers when handling bandwidths over 350 Mbps.

**Step 1: Register/Log in to GitHub and Light a "Star" 🌟 (In Memory of Dave Täht)**
 
Go to GitHub to register a free account and log in. Please visit the memorial repository and **click** the **"Star ⭐"** in the top right corner to pay tribute to Dave!
 
👉 [https://github.com/TW641/sch_cake](https://github.com/TW641/sch_cake)

**Step 2: Select Your Router Model and Fork the Project**
 
Based on the code you found in the table above, enter the corresponding link and **click** the **"Fork"** button in the top right corner:
 
🟢 **Classic Devices (Kernel 3.4)** 👉 [https://github.com/TW641/padavan-builder-workflow](https://github.com/TW641/padavan-builder-workflow)
 
🔵 **Advanced Devices (Kernel 4.4)** 👉 [https://github.com/TW641/padavan-4.4](https://github.com/TW641/padavan-4.4)

**Step 3: Enable Actions**
 
Go to your Forked project, **click** the **"Actions"** tab at the top, and **click** the green button **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**.

**Step 4: Select the Correct Workflow**
 
On the left side of the Actions page, **click** the corresponding workflow name based on your model:
 
🟢 **3.4 Models:** `Build firmware (Ultimate Fix - Early Size Check)`
 
🔵 **4.4 Models:** `Custom-Router-Build-Final-Fix`

**Step 5: One-Click Compile & Customize (IP/Password)**
 
**Click** the **"Run workflow"** dropdown menu on the right.
 
**[Most Important Step]** Enter your **"Option Code"** in the `Target Model` field (must perfectly match the one in the brackets from the table); for the language menu, enter `English_Only` (or `CN` if you prefer **Traditional Chinese**).
 
**Customization:** You can directly modify the default IP and password in the JSON field. If untouched, default values will be used. Finally, **click** the green **"Run workflow"** button!

**Step 6: Download & Flash**
 
Wait for about 10-15 minutes. Once the workflow shows a green checkmark ✅, **click** into the run, scroll to the bottom, and find **"Artifacts"** to download the ZIP file. The `.bin` file inside is your exclusive firmware!
